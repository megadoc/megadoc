# Megadoc

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/megadoc/megadoc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/megadoc/megadoc) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tinydoc/tinydoc/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/tinydoc/tinydoc?branch=master)

Megadoc is a documentation generator that is able to scan and analyze documentation found in different sources and present them in a coherent UI.
Example sources include source-files like JavaScript or Lua modules, Markdown
documents, and Ruby on Rails APIs.

## Motivation

- Write anywhere: docs may live inside the main codebase (in the form of comment blocks) or outside (like text or markdown files) - the tool shouldn't care.
- Aggregate, linkable docs: the ability to inter-link documents regardless of the source, like pointing to a JavaScript module from a Markdown article.
- Simple deployment model: .html files that require no webserver to power, so that one can easily host the docs anywhere (like on GitHub Pages, a local browser session, or any static server.)
